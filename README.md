Linear programming model to optimize production and outsourcing costs for Rougir Cosmetics, focusing on capacity constraints, labor allocation, and material usage.
# 💄 Rougir Cosmetics – LP Cost Optimization Model

This project applies **linear programming** to minimize production and outsourcing costs for **Rougir Cosmetics**, a global skincare brand. The model considers multiple constraints such as labor availability, material limits, and production demand to recommend the most cost-effective manufacturing strategy.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Rougir Cosmetics needed to optimize its in-house vs outsourced production strategy for three product lines:
- Face Cream
- Body Cream
- Hand Cream

The challenge was to minimize total cost while ensuring all customer demand is met, given labor and material constraints.

## ⚙️ Tools & Techniques

- **Excel Solver** – Optimization modeling
- **Linear Programming** – Minimize cost under constraints
- **Descriptive Analytics** – Scenario summaries and recommendations
- **Decision Variables** – In-house vs outsourced quantity per product
- **Constraints Considered**:
  - Labor hours by stage and shift
  - Raw material limits (water, oil, emulsifier, scent, jar)
  - Fixed and variable outsourcing cost

---

## 📊 Key Results

- **Minimum Total Cost**: $1,368,100  
- 100% of Face Cream and 87.5% of Body Cream were outsourced in base model  
- Main bottleneck: **Stage 1 labor capacity (Shift 1)**  
- Outsourcing was more cost-effective when labor constraints were tight

---

## 📈 Strategic Recommendations

1. **Increase Stage 1 Shift 1 Capacity**  
   Reduces outsourcing dependency and total cost

2. **Secure Material Inventory**  
   Especially for oil and scent, which were limiting factors

3. **Targeted Expansion**  
   Recommend expanding in markets with high demand for body care

4. **Sustainable Sourcing**  
   Incorporate organic materials and fair-labor practices to align with brand identity
